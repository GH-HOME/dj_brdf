This folder contains Mitsuba Plugins for the dj_brdf library.

To install, copy all the plugins, as well as the dj_brdf.h file into 
the src/bsdfs/ folder of the Mitsuba repository, and add them to the 
build script, e.g., add the following lines to the SconsScript file

# Materials from the dj_brdf library
plugins += env.SharedLibrary('dj_brdf', ['dj_brdf.cpp'])
plugins += env.SharedLibrary('dj_merl', ['dj_merl.cpp'])
plugins += env.SharedLibrary('dj_utia', ['dj_utia.cpp'])
plugins += env.SharedLibrary('dj_abc',  ['dj_abc.cpp'])
plugins += env.SharedLibrary('dj_sgd',  ['dj_sgd.cpp'])
plugins += env.SharedLibrary('dj_beckmannconductor', ['dj_beckmannconductor.cpp'])

You may now recompile Mitsuba and start using the plugins.

The dj_beckmannconductor plugin allows users to load normal maps with 
LEAN/LEADR map filtering. You can generate custom LEAN texture maps from 
the utilities I provide in the utils/ folder. Note that I already provide
a few maps in the dj_matpreview.zip file.
